# pixcells 📸

A personal photography portfolio showcasing moments captured with my Canon R50 + 50mm f/1.8.

## About

I'm still a beginner just having fun and playing around with my camera. I try to be active with orgs as well, capturing events and random moments that catch my eye. Fair warning though, I can't post process to save my life, so what you see is pretty much straight out of camera (with maybe some light editing for when I am motivated).

## Getting Started

```

2. **Run the development server:**

npm run dev
```

3. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser

## Adding New Albums

1. **Add your images** to `public/albums/[album-name]/`

2. **Create album file** in `lib/albums/[album-name].ts`:

```typescript
export const myAlbum = {
  album: [
    { id: "3000", url: "/albums/my-album/1.jpg" },
    { id: "3001", url: "/albums/my-album/2.jpg" },
    // add more images...
  ],
};
```

3. **Update the store** in `store/albums.store.ts`:

```typescript
import { myAlbum } from "@/lib/albums/my-album";

export const useAlbumsStore = create<AlbumsStore>(() => ({
  albums: [
    { name: "My Album", album: myAlbum },
    // other albums...
  ],
}));
```

That's it. Your new album will show up everywhere automatically.
